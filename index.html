          Hi! ðŸ‘‹

        I'm Brendan and I'm an aspiring software engineer who has been fascinated by technology since my very first Commodore 64.

        I'm energized by finding solutions to complex problems in creative ways and exploring new things with an unceasing curiosity.

        I aspire to improve digital equity--ensuring that everyone has a chance to benefit from our amazing technologies. As a former teacher, leader, and professional coach, I'm passionate about making sure my work helps those who need it most.
